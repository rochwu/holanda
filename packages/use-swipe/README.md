# use-swipe

So I wrote this for the `hablaba` project and I truly don't remember what I did here. I just remember the libs I was eyeing didn't do what I wanted to so I made my own. I was bored during cancer recovery so I might have too much time on my hands. But I truly don't know how any of this works anymore lol, I should've left some comments

Some stuff I remember

- I had to fight some acceleration from Mac or iOS, one of the two
- I think? Scroll wheels doesn't work but I don't have any to try them out! ðŸ˜†
